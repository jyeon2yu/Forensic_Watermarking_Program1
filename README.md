# Forensic Watermarking Program (MFC)
<h3>1. Purpose</h3>
We embed watermark image produced with userâ€™s information in digital image to track illegal distribution path.
We proposed a method that retains JPEG compression robustness by using DWT-DCT and obtain security by embedding watermark using CRT.

<h3>2. Setting for C++, OpenCV</h3>
We maked this program using C++, OpenCV, Visual Studio. <br>
1. Visual Studio
2. C++
3. OpenCV 3.4.16

<h3>3. Architecture</h3>
ðŸ“Œ 512 x 512 image!
